# Reproducible Research Project
 
With this project we want to implement the previuos Research Article about "Determinant of Human Development Index
in ASEAN Countries" Where we have taken data from 2000 - 2015 of HDI differences among ten member countries, Singapore and Brunei Darussalamhad 
included in the category of the very high human development index. Malaysia and
Thailand include in high human development index. Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines,
Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar include in medium human development index. These HDI
differences show that there is a difference in government policies priorities among the ASEAN
countries. 

The first step in this research we estimate using fixed-effect model. After that using the
Chow-test we can see that we reject the null hypothesis or not. Later, we can see the Chow-test result
The next step we estimate the equation with random effect model. After that using the using
the Hausman-test, we can see that we can or cannot reject the null hypothesis.

This project is an Assigment for "Reproducible Research", University of Warsaw Faculty of Economic Sciences.
